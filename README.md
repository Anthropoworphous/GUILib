GUILIB
***
Why would I use or even make this one when there is a better one existed already?

tbh idk

local .m2 repo go download and add this yourself lol

```html
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.anthropoworphous</groupId>
    <artifactId>GUILib</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

you also need the OWOToolkit btw

here is the link: https://github.com/Anthropoworphous/OWOToolkit
